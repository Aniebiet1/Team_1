  "Computer History": {
    "content": "<h3>Computer History</h3><p>The history of computers dates back to ancient civilizations with the development of tools like the abacus and early mechanical calculating devices. However, the modern computer era began in the 20th century with the advent of electronic machines that could perform more complex calculations.</p><h3>Key Events</h3><ul><li><strong>Pascaline (1642):</strong> Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, a mechanical calculator that could add and subtract numbers.</li><li><strong>Difference Engine (1822):</strong> Charles Babbage designed the Difference Engine, which is often considered the first mechanical computer. His later design, the Analytical Engine, laid the groundwork for programmable computers.</li><li><strong>ENIAC (1945):</strong> The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first fully electronic general-purpose computer. It marked a turning point in the development of computing.</li></ul><h3>World War II Impact</h3><p>The Second World War had a significant influence on the development of computers. The need for faster calculations, such as for cryptography and artillery firing tables, led to the development of machines like Colossus, which was used to break codes. These advancements accelerated the transition from mechanical to electronic computing.</p>"
